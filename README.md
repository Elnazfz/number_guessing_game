# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ²

## Description
A simple console-based Number Guessing Game implemented in C++. The program generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the program provides hints whether the guess is too high or too low. This project demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, random number generation, and basic C++ syntax.

## Technologies
- C++
- Console input/output
- Random number generation
- Loops and conditional statements

## How to Use
Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, CLion), compile and run the main.cpp file. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the number. The program will indicate if your guess is too high or too low until you find the correct number.

## Learning Outcomes
- Practiced using loops (`while`, for`) and conditionals (`if, else if, `else`) in C++.
- Learned to generate random numbers and handle user input.
- Developed problem-solving skills through game logic implementation.
